Provide instructions on how to compile and run your code, especially if you used a nonstandard Makefile, or you are one of those hackers who insists on doing things differently.

All original files are in the same folders as the master, except the addition of the triangle shaders, so should compile and run with the same makefile.

Indicate if you met all problem set requirements (more importantly, let us know where your bugs are and what you did to try to eliminate the bugs; we want to give you as much partial credit as we can).

All requirements have been met.  

Provide some overview of the code design. Don't go into details; just give us the big picture.

Created new shaders for the triangle implementation following the square shader formats.  

Let us know how to run the program; what are the hot keys, mouse button usage, and so on? Describe steps or sequences of steps the TF should take to test and evaluate your code (especially if your implmenentation strays from the assignment specification).

Use the mouse to resize the window and the i,j,k,l keys to move the triangle.

Finally, did you implement anything above and beyond the problem set? If so, document it in order for the TFs to test it and evaluate it.

Nope.
